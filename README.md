# GraphQL client training

---

A minimalistic front-end project to help me train at handling GraphQL on the front side of a project.

It directly connects to [my own GraphQL API](https://github.com/Julien-Allard/graphql-server-training) which fetches data from the [Rick & Morty REST API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/).

The visual are lacking right now but it wasn't my primary goal here.
